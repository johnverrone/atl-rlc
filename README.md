# atl-rlc
Web application used to track player, team, and league stats in Rocket League.

> The application is split into two parts: `client/` and `server/`. The server
> side uses node and express along side a postgresql database. The client side is
> currently written in es2015 javascript using the [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) framework.
> The UI framework is still up in the air. There isn't much support for material design stuff yet.
> A aurelia interface library is coming soon from the core team, so stay tuned.
